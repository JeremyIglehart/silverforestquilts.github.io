### by Sandi Blackwell

This quilt was designed to show a simple block put on point with my Square-agonals©technique and how it elevates a quilt design and makes it look more complex than it is.

"Jackie's working is outstanding, she has the "eye" to take elements from the quilt design and incorporate it into the quilting, Love her work!" 

 Jackie's note:  Sandi Blackwell, owner of ["Stitched Buy"] (https://www.stitchedbuy.com), is the creator of this wonderful technique known as Square-agonals© and can be contacted by email at stitchedbuy@aol.com and her patterns, books and info on speaking engagements can be found at her website by clicking on the link above.
