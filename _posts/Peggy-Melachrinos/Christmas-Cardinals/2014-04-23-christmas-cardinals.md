### by Peggy M.

Note by Jackie:  Peggy had made this quilt several years ago and it had been quilted by another longarm quilter back then.  She did a very nice job by quilting a frame around the bird "panels", but did not do any quilting around the birds themselves.  As the quilt was used, the bird panel fabric became loose and puffy.  Peggy asked me if I might have a solution.  Knowing that the process of quilting "pulls" the fabric in, making it tighter, I suggested that she let me use a free motion technique following the details of the prints.  I used gold metalic thread to match the metallic gold in the prints, which had such a nice effect.  Peggy and I were both pleased with the solution.  Some of the photos above show the "before" and "after" on some of the panels.  Thanks, Peggy, for letting me put the finishing touches on this fun quilt!
