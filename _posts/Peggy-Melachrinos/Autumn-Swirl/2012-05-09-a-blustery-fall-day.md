### by Peggy M.

I have always loved the fall colors.  I also have had a desire to work with Batik fabrics.  When I found the Oak Leaf batik fabric, a quilt was born.   I purchased the border and built from there.  I had seen a similar design in a magazine but it had appliqued Maple Leaves so I substituted Oak Leaves for my quilt.  This was my first applique project and some folks discouraged me from undertaking the project.  I found the process of fusible applique with machine stitching not nearly as difficult as I was led to believe.  When I was done I was very pleased with the outcome.

I brought my quilt to Jackie for longarm quilting. When it was time to pick a pattern we discussed my vision over the phone. Jackie did a fabulous job of interpreting my ideas.  I imagined a breezy fall day with leaves swirling around and that's exactly what I see when I look at the quilt.  We also picked an oak leaf pattern for the border.  The thread is variegated and just a perfect complement to the fall color scheme.  I love snuggling under my quilt on those blustery fall days.
