# 1930’s Reflections

## Pieced by: Beverly W

I love 30's material and childhood images of those old quilts at my grandparents’ farm. My other daughter got this quilt because she has a fascination with those old fashion days of yesteryear.

I took my quilt tops to Jackie to quilt and had as much fun picking the quilting designs and color of the threads as I did in the quilt store picking out the colors of material to piece the tops together.  It was great to have Jackie's suggestions with pattern designs for the quilting. Jackie didn't ;mind spending the time with you in making your choices and treated each quilt as if it was a masterpiece going to be in the Smithsonian.  It was very important to her that you were happy with the choices made and the outcome of the quilted piece.  Thank you Jackie-I have more quilts coming.
