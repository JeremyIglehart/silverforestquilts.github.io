### by Candy G.
 
This was a guild workshop and when I arrived at class, I realized I didnâ€™t purchase enough fabric to do it the way the instructor intended.  However, she allowed me to use another pattern from her book.  It was my first strata quilt and I enjoyed making it.
 
The quilting was absolutely lovely!  Jackie worked with me to select a pattern and gave input on designs that would work the best.  She recommended the thread and it was perfect!
