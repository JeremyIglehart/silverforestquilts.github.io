### by Amanda Gonzales

I made this quilt for my brother for Christmas. He has been asking my mom to make him a quilt for years and I decided to take on the challenge. The design and colors were easy to pick out, but the patchwork took me a few days. I do have to say he absolutely loved it. 

Jackie did an amazing job on the quilt. I love her work and will continue to use her in the future. She did my quilt within the time frame I needed and got it back to me before the date I gave her. She did an amazing job and my brother loves it.
