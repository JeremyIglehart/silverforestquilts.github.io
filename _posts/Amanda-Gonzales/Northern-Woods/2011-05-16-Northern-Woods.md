### by Amanda Gonzales

I made this quilt for my mom. She has a 31 ft camper on a seasonal site.  She spent her whole life teaching me how to camp and roughing it, and now she deserves a break.  So I saw this as a kit in a local quilt shop and knew I had to make it for her. It was hard and so it took me out of my comfort zone of quilting.  Even when I had the whole top done and was ready to send it to Jackie to quilt something didn't look right.  That is when I realized three blocks had to be taken out and turned 180* and then sewn back in.  I had the boarders on and everything.  I had to learn to sew squares back in a finished quilt. I cried so hard that night.  But I got it done, and got it to Jackie and my mom LOVES her quilt.
