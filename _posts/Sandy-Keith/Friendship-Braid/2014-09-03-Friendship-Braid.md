### by Sandy Keith

This was the first quilt I've ever made where the pieces had to intersect one another. It took me a bit to figure out how things went and after that it was easy. The quilt looks much harder than it was and now I know I can do more than straight blocks.

This quilt was to be a gift and as always, I wanted the work I'd done to be front and center and not the quilting. As always, Jackie obliged with a lovely pattern that just made my work shine. I am always so thrilled when one of the quilts she's finished for me comes back. The family I gave it to told me they "loved it." I do believe it's the only handmade quilt they've ever had.
