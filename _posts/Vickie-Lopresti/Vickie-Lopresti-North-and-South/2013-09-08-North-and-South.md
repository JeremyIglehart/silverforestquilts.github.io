About two years ago ... at the Valley Forge Homestead Quilt Guild Spring Retreat, a group of us got together and used the guildâ€™s die cutter to cut a bunch of our Civil War Reproduction fat quarters into tumbler pieces.  We each had to supply 25 fat quarters.  However, my quilt sort of had a mind of its own and I made it into a queen sized quilt.  

I'm very pleased with the way Jackie quilted it.   We spoke at length about what design to use and which thread color.  She took her time, and explained everything.   Will keep going back!!!
